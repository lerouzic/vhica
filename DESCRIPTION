Description: The "Vertical and Horizontal Inheritance Consistence Analysis" method is described in the following publication: "VHICA: a new method to discriminate between vertical and horizontal transposon transfer: application to the mariner family within Drosophila" by G. Wallau. and collaborators, Mol. Biol. Evol. (in press). The purpose of the method is to detect horizontal transfers of transposable elements, by contrasting the divergence of transposable element sequences with that of regular genes.
