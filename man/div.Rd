\title{
	Computation of the synonymous divergence between sequences
}
\description{
	The divergence between DNA sequences can be synonymous (neutral) or non-synonymous. Synonymous differences are generally considered as a better proxy for evolutionary divergence, as it is not affected by selection. This function computes the synonymous divergence between sequences. 
}
\usage{
div(file = NULL, sequence = NULL, sqs = NULL, method = "LWL85", pairwise = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{file}{FASTA file in which aligned sequences are stored.
}
  \item{sequence}{Alternatively, the result of seqinr::read.fasta.
}
  \item{sqs}{Vector of sequence names to be compared. If not provided, all pairwise comparisons will be performed.
}
  \item{method}{Method used to compute the divergence. So far, only the LWL85 method (from Li et al. 1985).
}
  \item{pairwise}{Boolean: should the divergence be calculated for each pair of sequences or on the whole dataset? This is of particular importance when indels (gaps) are present in sequences, as codons with gaps are generally discarded by most methods. Setting this option to \code{TRUE} is thus more likely to give accurate results with multiple-gap sequences, but the calculation will also be slower.
}
}
\details{
	The \code{LWL85} method is a wrapper around the \code{kaks} function from the \code{seqinr} package. 
}
\value{
	A 3-column data frame with the following fields:
	\itemize{
		\item{sq1:} {The first sequence in the comparison}
		\item{sq2:} {The second sequence in the comparison}
		\item{div:} {The divergence score}
	}
