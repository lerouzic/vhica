\title{
	Computes the Codon Usage Bias of DNA sequences
}
\description{
	The function reads aligned sequences in a fasta file and estimates the codon usage bias for each sequence. Several methods exist to estimate CUB; so far, only the "Effective Number of Codons" (ENC) calculation is available. 
}
\usage{
CUB(file = NULL, sequence = NULL, method = "ENC")
}
\arguments{
  \item{file}{FASTA file in which aligned sequences are stored.
}
  \item{sequence}{Alternatively, the result of seqinr::read.fasta.
}
  \item{method}{The method used to compute CUB. "ENC": Effective Number of Codons, as described in Wright (1990). 
}
}
\value{
A named vector of CUB scores. Names correspond to sequence names in the dataset.
